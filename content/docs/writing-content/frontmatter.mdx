Every MDX file starts with a YAML frontmatter block between `---` delimiters.

## Required Fields

```yaml
---
title: Page Title
---
```

The `title` field is the only required field. It appears in the page header, sidebar, search results, and browser tab.

## Optional Fields

```yaml
---
title: Page Title
description: A brief description of this page.
order: 1
published: true
---
```

## Field Reference

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `title` | `string` | required | Page title (max 120 characters) |
| `description` | `string` | — | Description for SEO and search (max 300 characters) |
| `order` | `number` | `999` | Sort order within its directory |
| `published` | `boolean` | `true` | Set to `false` to hide from production |

<Callout type="tip" title="Ordering">
  Pages are sorted by `order` value. Use increments of 1 (1, 2, 3...) for easy reordering later.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  Unpublished pages (`published: false`) are excluded from the sidebar, search, and pagination. They still render if accessed directly during development.
</Callout>
